Inspired by the workings of the brain, John Hopfield, a US professor emeritus at Princeton University, and Geoffrey Hinton, a British-Canadian professor emeritus at the University of Toronto, built artificial neural networks that store and retrieve memories like the human brain, and learn from information fed into them. Hinton, 76, who is often called 'the godfather of AI', made headlines last year when he quit Google and warned about the dangers of machines outsmarting humans. Announced by the Royal Swedish Academy of Sciences in Stockholm, the winners share the 11m Swedish kronor (about £810,000) prize for 'foundational discoveries and inventions that enable machine learning with artificial neural networks. Speaking at a press briefing immediately after the announcement, Hinton said he had received the call from Stockholm while staying in a cheap hotel in California that lacked an internet connection.
