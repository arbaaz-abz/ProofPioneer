Instruction Prompt:

Task:

Given the following excerpt from a news article, extract unique and meaningful entities and their relationships. Represent them as triples in the format: Subject, Predicate, Object. Each triple should capture a significant action or event described in the text, focusing on important entities such as people, organizations, locations, and noteworthy events.

Guidelines:
- Entities: Identify key subjects and objects, such as individuals (e.g., POTUS), organizations (e.g., CDC), countries (e.g., China), and significant events (e.g., First COVID-19 death).
- Relationships: Determine the actions or associations that link these entities (e.g., issues, signs, recommends).
- Complex Relationships: For sentences where the predicate is a complex phrase or includes multiple actions, strive to capture the core meaning using a concise predicate. If necessary, break down complex sentences into multiple triples to maintain clarity.
- Neutrality: Extract relationships exactly as presented in the text, without adding personal opinions, judgments, or disclaimers about the content.
- Language: Use the language and terms provided in the excerpt.
- Uniqueness: Ensure that each relationship is unique and adds meaningful information for building a knowledge graph.
- Clarity: Your triples must be clear and concise concise.
- Avoid: Do not include trivial details, duplicate information, or unrelated data. Do not add personal commentary, disclaimers, or alter the tone of the original text.
