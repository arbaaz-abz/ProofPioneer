Instruction Prompt:
Given the following excerpt from a news article, extract unique and meaningful entities and their relationships. Represent them as triples in the format: Subject, Predicate, Object. Each triple should capture a significant action or event described in the text, focusing on important entities such as people, organizations, locations, and noteworthy events.

Guidelines:
* Entities: Identify key subjects and objects, such as individuals (e.g., POTUS), organizations (e.g., CDC), countries (e.g., China), and significant events (e.g., First COVID-19 death).
* Relationships: Determine the actions or associations that link these entities (e.g., issues, signs, recommends).
* Complex Relationships: For sentences where the predicate is a complex phrase or includes multiple actions, strive to capture the core meaning using a concise predicate. If necessary, break down complex sentences into multiple triples to maintain clarity.
* Neutrality: Extract relationships exactly as presented in the text, without adding personal opinions, judgments, or disclaimers about the content.
* Language: Use the language and terms provided in the excerpt.
* Uniqueness: Ensure that each relationship is unique and adds meaningful information for building a knowledge graph.
* Clarity: Your triples must be clear and concise concise.
* Connectivity:
    - Ensure Full Connectivity: All extracted triples should be interconnected through shared entities to form a single, cohesive knowledge graph.
    - Avoid Disconnected Subgraphs: Do not extract triples that belong to entirely separate contexts or clusters within the text.
    - Prioritize Interrelated Information: When possible, prefer relationships that link different entities together, thereby enhancing the connectivity of the knowledge graph.
    - Bridge Entities: If multiple clusters of information exist, identify and extract relationships that bridge these clusters through common entities.
* Avoid: Do not include trivial details, duplicate information, or unrelated data. Do not add personal commentary, disclaimers, or alter the tone of the original text.

Example 1:

Article Excerpt:
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that travelers defer all cruise travel worldwide and avoid all nonessential travel to China.

Extracted Triples:
[{"subject": Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "predicate": recommends, "object": travelers defer cruise travel worldwide},
{"subject": Centers for Disease Control and Prevention, "predicate": recommends, "object": avoid nonessential travel to China}]

Example 2:

Article Excerpt:
But the gist of it is that national Democrats, aided by Hollywood and a group of “global elites”, are running a massive ring devoted to the abduction, trafficking, torture, sexual abuse, and cannibalization of children, all with the purpose of fulfilling the rituals of their Satanic faith.

Extracted Triples:
[{"subject": National Democrats, "predicate": aided by, "object": Hollywood},
{"subject": National Democrats, "predicate": aided by, "object": global elites},
{"subject": National Democrats, "predicate": running, "object": Massive ring},
{"subject": Massive ring, "predicate": devoted, "object": abduction},
{"subject": Massive ring, "predicate": devoted, "object": trafficking},
{"subject": Massive ring, "predicate": devoted, "object": torture},
{"subject": Massive ring, "predicate": devoted, "object": sexual abuse},
{"subject": Massive ring, "predicate": devoted, "object": cannibalization of children},
{"subject": Massive ring, "predicate": purpose, "object": fulfilling rituals of Satanic faith}]
