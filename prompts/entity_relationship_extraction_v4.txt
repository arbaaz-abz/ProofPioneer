Instruction Prompt:
Given the following excerpt from a news article, extract unique and meaningful entities and their relationships. Represent them as triples in the format: Subject, Predicate, Object. Each triple should capture a significant action or event described in the text, focusing on important entities such as people, organizations, locations, and noteworthy events.

Guidelines:
* Entities: Identify key subjects and objects, such as individuals (e.g., POTUS), organizations (e.g., CDC), countries (e.g., China), and significant events (e.g., First COVID-19 death).
* Relationships: Determine the actions or associations that link these entities (e.g., issues, signs, recommends).
* Complex Relationships: For sentences where the predicate is a complex phrase or includes multiple actions, capture the core meaning using a concise predicates. If necessary, break down complex sentences into multiple triples to maintain clarity.
* Neutrality: While extracting relationships do not add personal opinions, judgments, or disclaimers about the content.
* Language: Use the language and terms provided in the excerpt.
* Uniqueness: Ensure that each relationship is unique and adds meaningful information for building a knowledge graph.
* Clarity: Your triples must be clear and concise concise.
* Connectivity: If possible, ensure graph connectivity, where all triples are interconnected through shared bridge entities to form a single, cohesive knowledge graph.
* Avoid: Do not include trivial details or unrelated data. Do not add personal commentary, disclaimers, or alter the tone of the original text.

Example 1:

Article Excerpt:
Centers for Disease Control and Prevention recommends that travelers defer all cruise travel worldwide and avoid all nonessential travel to China.
